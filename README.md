# HumanActivityRecognition
Created for the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Johns Hopkins Univeristy through Coursera

The purpose of the project is to become familiar with getting and cleaning data to produce a tidy data set in which
each column represents one characteristic of the set of objects and each row represents an object. The data used
for this project can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
The data used in this analysis was downloaded on 6/21/2015. 

R script run_analysis.R meets the requirements of the assigned project in that it:
       1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
       2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
       3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
       4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
       5. Creates another tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
